# Pancake Maker Task - REACT25K

Welcome to the Pancake Maker project repository for deployment! This repository contains files to complete 3 steps of Pancake maker project during REACT25K JavaScript course at Business College Helsinki.

## Project Outline

1. An interactive webpage where customers make pancake orders with toppings, extras, and delivery options, also checking price updates dynamically. - To see the order summary first, and then to confirm the order.

2. The chef can check confirmed orders at All Orders page and search orders by name or order ID. He/she can change each order's status from "waiting" to "ready" and "delivered", then orders are sorted to show "waiting" orders first and "delivered" orders last. When the order is delivered, the chef can remove the order card.
